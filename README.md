# Bay Area driving time status board

[check it out](https://moz-commute.herokuapp.com)

I built this for the Mozilla Mountain View office to show the current drive times to various points in the Bay Area.

It's powered by 511.org's [Driving Times API](http://511.org/developer-resources_driving-times-api.asp)

To run it, you'll need a 511.org API key set as the environment variable `API_TOKEN`.

It's currently hard-coded to have the nearest intersection to Mozilla's Mountain View office as the starting point.

If you'd like to set it up for your own use, file an issue and I'll try to help!
